Fort Worcester


Fort Worcester (French: Faubourg-Wevelgem) is a British military installation on German soil, near Foch. It is one of the British Army’s three main underground serving stations.


== History ==
The installation was built as a Junior Stone Camp for the 2nd Battalion, 23rd Volunteer Battalion in the 16th Scottish Light Division (2/23rd/DK) and is named after the Battle of Famylight of 11 July 1944. As part of the Army's counter-naval campaign directed against the German lands east of the River Rhine, the landings commenced from September 1943 and contained an initial landing force of about 600. However, on 19 March 1944, a battalion troopship, the Pioneer, failed to arrive at Famylight Island, and the Second Battle of Famylight was fought on 9–10 June 1944.Another monument commemorates the 21st Battalion of British Army's armoured units. The plaque was designed by Frank Dunne (1898–1971) and erected in 1939 with the help of the Gloucestershire Heritage Trust. The plaque was unveiled on 22 April 1943 by Major-General Cecil Jellinek and each year a new plaque is unveiled.


== Facilities ==
The command on Famylight operated six Underground Service Stations. Most were given to the 4th Battalion, The Royal Gloucestershire Regiment (4th/12th Cavalry), some to the 20th Battalion, The Royal Highland Fusiliers, and other more permanent overnight accommodation to the 6th/17th (Dorset, The Queen's Regiment) Battalion, The Royal Anglian Regiment and several to the 85th (Philadelphian) Battalion, The Royal Gurkhas Rifles.

History of the Pennsylvania [city] system


The History of the Pennsylvania [city] system was published in great detail, with numerous illustrations, and was the most extensive sources of information on the modern Pennsylvania state government.
It was printed, and continued to be published by the Pittsburgh Historical Society after 1923.
The Pittsburgh Historical Society, in partnership with the Pennsylvania State Library of the University of Pittsburgh, reprinted it in three volumes in the 1980s, with back issues published by the Library of Congress for the first time in 1988.
While originally an in-depth study of the Pennsylvania state government during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, the article on the History of the Pennsylvania system now entitled "The history of the Pennsylvania [city] system" has been updated to accurately reflect the changes in the standards of historical scholarship in the modern era.
In addition to two new sections (the interactive version and the textbook edition), the history of the system has also undergone significant changes, reflecting a divergence from the views of the founding fathers of the system.
For example, in its original version, the state legislature was envisioned as the only venues for debate on important laws and policies. Now, the legislature includes an agreement-making body that provides input into all laws, even ones it doesn't approve of.

Bombay Short Form


The Bombay Short Form (BBF) is a short form designed to be used as short form or print on other printed materials and materials that include a female subject. It is used in Japanese military and international publications and is used everywhere from advertisements to in-jokes. BBFs are just another form of Japanese script and are not restricted in what it can be used for. During the Japanese Occupation, Japanese newspapers printed Japanese-written BBFs that used different characters when the articles used to bore into a viewer. The promotion of the BBF was soon stopped and set to be replaced with the other forms.
The BBF also appears in posters and in-jokes that are most commonly seen as a possible parody of Japanese's, specifically the depiction of Japanese soldiers being unintelligent, dimwitted and unable to master English. The BBF can also explain the lack of English grammar and punctuation as a coding system for the Japanese language. After the publication of the 2013 video entry (originally titled Trailrage), fliers were presented by Tokyo Metropolitan Government to the local businesses as a parody of Japanese-written BBFs.

French-Norwegian plan for Norway peace
1922

The plan for a Norwegian peace in 1918 was of great importance to the Norwegian government, as the war had brought to Norway a major economic and military advantage compared to British and American plans. By going to war with England, the Allies had also brought to Norway tremendous political advantage. It was, however, in Germany's interests to go to war with the US. By going to war with England, the Allies had also brought to Norway the greatest peace-maker of the British Empire. There had been fears that the German Empire's economic advantages would be lost in the conflict, but by destroying the British Empire's advantage while it was still in existence, the Russian Empire and Prussia could now claim it as their own.

Peter Hodgson


Peter Joseph Hodgson  (31 May 1958 – 16 October 2013) was a New Zealand politician and a member of the House of Representatives from 1994 to 1998. He represented the Mana Party in the Wellington City Council from 2004 to 2007, representing the Waikato electorate, and the elector for the Wellington electorate. He was a cabinet minister and minister of State for Defence from 1993 to 1997 under Brian Mulroney and Deputy Prime Minister for Trade and Investment from 1997 to 1999, and Minister of Finance from 1999 to 2001.


== Early life ==
Hodgson was born in Mangere in 1958. By the age of eleven, he had become a rugby player. He later joined the New Zealand Army Reserve and went on to complete his military training.


== Political career ==
In the 1997 elections, Hodgson stood for Parliament for the Waikato electorate. He defeated the incumbent Labour MP Bill Bailey, who had been elected in the 1998 election, by 2,549 votes to take the seat. The constituency of Wellington East has a population of 20,000, approximately the same as Wellington Central and many times the population as the Westland electorate. The electorate had not previously been held by a Labour MP and its boundaries were composed of a number of isolated constituencies, which Hodgson may have owned; to secure his victory, he did not seek re-election in 1998.


== Later life ==
Hodgson retired on 29 September 2010 from Wellington-based The Flying Grapple, an outdoor entertainment company.  Prior to retiring from the business, Hodgson was president of The Flying Grapple, a volunteer-based organisation for over a decade.

Alaska National Guard


The Alaska National Guard is a component of the Alaska National Guard, which began on 1 October 1960.


== History ==
The Alaska National Guard was created on 1 October 1960 as a replacement for the current, largely inactive reserve unit. In 1971 the Governor of Alaska with the support of the Legislature passed legislation allowing the Governor to create new units with the same number of soldiers.  In 1972 the Governor left the military standing for the first time in over a decade. The Alaska National Guard and the Army National Guard became separate entities.
Alaska National Guard units were activated on 13 January 1983. 
The Alaska National Guard consists of approximately 1,600 soldiers at a cost of over $18 billion.  In addition, the Alaska National Guard is equipped with a wide variety of equipment, including the M16 rifle, M63 grenade launcher and M240 Browning machine gun.The Alaska National Guard is designed to be an operational unit, with a primary mission being to protect life and property (including sponsoring educational events) here at home. The design of the National Guard reflects the ideals of the United States Army Air Forces as the primary service. During peacetime and military emergencies, the Alaska National Guard may be activated for a limited number of military missions or disaster relief missions that are designed to sustain maximum readiness while minimizing disruption to the vital services.


== Organization ==

There are four groups of Alaska National Guard units:

122nd Air Refueling Squadron The primary mission of the 122rd Air Refueling Squadron is to return fuel to duty stations and provide air refueling to planes participating in active combat against al Qaeda and the Taliban.
124th Air Refueling Squadron The primary mission of the 124th Air Refueling Squadron is to return fuel to duty stations and provide air refueling to airplanes participating in active combat against al Qaeda and the Taliban.
119th Maintenance Company The primary mission of the 119th Maintenance Company is to provide maintenance support, insurance and supply to 24 troop carriers and crew of ALDEFOLINE, Washington State Guard, Alaska National Guard and the Alaska Naval Militia.

Robert H. Morris


Robert H. Morris (c. 1765 –  c. 1777) was a member of the Aleutian Islands Expeditionary Force which was sent in 1776 as part of the British involvement in the American Revolutionary War. Morris was a native of Bunker Island, New York. During this expedition, he participated in several battles, including the Battle of Fort Hamilton (1802), the Battle of the Flatheads (1802), the Battle of Berea (1803), and the Battle of Tallahassee (1804). He was captured at the opening of the War of 1812, and was arrested by the British before being brought to the East in April 1776. Morris and his companions were charged with being spies for Britain. They were charged under the 1802 Act which authorized the British to detain any American soldier suspected of providing valuable intelligence to Prime Minister Benjamin Disraeli and his government. Because of their ages (Morris was 35 and his companion was 18, and requested amnesty) even though he was charged, there was no trial before the courts, so the penalty was to be death. Morris asked for 30 lashes, and was acquitted by the judge. Morris was retried and sentenced to both his personal and military services. He was released from military service in 1815 for remaining at Fort Sagas after destroying his sword. He did not seek approval for their enlistment, and was discharged in November, 1816.

Vacuum Tube


The Vacuum Tube was a disposable non-dural microphone used during the mid 20th century as a makeshift laboratory instrument for hearing loss.
It was used as a sounding board during the Second World War (WW2) to help soldiers communicate with base commanders and Equipment Officers. The pit safeties were similar to the French M63 tripod valve used by D-Day landings and the used by British Imperial Forces during 1945 to conduct long range air drops of Focke-Wulf Fw 190 heavy light aircraft with the vibration dampening field. The tube tungsten alloy box did not need to be powered by batteries and could be left on a table without interfering with the tungsten radio isostatic balance plate. The tube's hard plastic tungsten alloy box tiscans were sometimes used for use under a microscope, hence the name. It was the same model as used for Fw 190's transmission and reception settings.

The Australian air force insignia stand for the rank and general insignia, and mimics the insignia of the Royal Australian Navy which was commanded by a second lieutenant when she was known as a gunboat tender. This insignia has now been replaced by the Royal Australian Air Force insignia for all personnel.


== BBC History Australian Air Force insignia ==
The insignia consists of a silver rating platform, centered on a silver circle with a white circle in the center. It is approximated by the pedestal and green desert background, which are associated with the monarchy, and the trials and tribulations of the small fleet of vessels. The rating platform is surmounted by the same silver ring that is worn on the Australian airman's jack and is worn from the left of an Australian airman's cap to the right of a lieutenant's jock.

Its mission is to provide health, education and treatment facilities to soldiers, the Canadian Forces, and their families. RHH is connected to other hospitals in the nearby cities of Burnaby and Vancouver. RHH supports over 40,000 soldiers, support personnel, and families, and has a staff of more than 1,000.
RHH's former Chief Medical Officer, Major General David Millich, was Chief of GPs for 4 months during 1991. The hospital received many commendations for offering health services not only to Canadian troops, but also to civilians and refugees. Millich became Chief of GPs for RHH in April 1995, but was replaced by Victor Jaffe prior to the start of 1997. David Millich was the hospital's medical director from 1992 to 1998. In 1990, the hospital and many other hospitals in the province took geriatric services under The Ellice Family Health Cooperative. Major Dr. David Ellice became director in 1995 when Major General William Ellice retired. In 1993, the Canadian Forces occupied the hospital, and the housing was donated to the Province of British Columbia.

Turner published How the Patriotic Service Helped the Allies, based on Phillips's experiences in 1914. In a discussion of the battle, Phillips wrote "We soon found ourselves facing the Turks taking off all their guns in order to avoid making further incursions into our flanks. After several rounds fired with an empty case of ammunition we were obliged to retreat through brush and filled with drowned water. Now we would have to fight or give up. The gun was useless because it was completely disabled. I could only take aim with it the entire time." Phillips was injured in the action and informed that he was medically evacuated from Canada to England where he was badly injured. Phillips was finally evacuated after the war but was found to be in poor health.

MRAF (alleged)


The Alleged MRAF (alleged) or MRAF (exaggeration), also known as the MRAF's Resurgent , appears to be an arcanoized, possibly arctic mask made by Canada's St. John's Armoury. Mike Seif is said to have copied the mask when he was 16 years old.According to several sources, the mask is reputedly made from snow that had been frozen by retreating polar bears, and is said to resemble the original. A notorious Canadian ski mask researcher, geologist and author of the 1953 book Canada's Stealth Invasion, Michael Field, has said that the mask is a fake forgeries.Since there is no proof that the MRAF is indeed a contemporary hoax, the MRAF101 criticality symbol is often used as a symbol of the MRAF hoax, and can be seen on many websites.

Louisiana National Guard


The Louisiana National Guard consists of over 1500 members, who serve in every county in the state. Each major city in Louisiana is assigned one National Guard member, and the reservation in which they live and serve is determined by county government.


== Louisiana National Guard members ==
Reservations for the National Guard are held by local governments as required. This information is posted on the Louisiana National Guard website at http://www.army.la.gov/.


=== International Operations ===


=== Reserve Personnel ===
Reservations for the United States National Guard, including reservists, are held by local governments by regulation.  National Guard Reserve and National Guard Active (i.e. Reserve security Forces composed entirely of reserve personnel) personnel are not legally obligated to serve in a National Guard unit. Instead, they are considered a "bona fide reserve" under United States Military Reserve Organization regulations (MCRO regulations). The Reserve component of the National Guard consists entirely of National Guard personnel.

The United States Army Reserve is itself composed of reservists, but in a far lesser degree than the National Guard Reserve.

The United States Marine Corps Reserve comprises reservists currently serving in the United States Navy Reserve.

9 Army Band


The 9 Army Band of the British Army were commissioned in 2017. The 9 Army Band were designed as an evolution of the original 600 Band. Together they form the UK's 7th Army Band. The 9 Army Band is the smallest British Army band available to the public. The bands are larger than the bands in the Royal Corps of Transport, the British Army Band, and the Naval Band in the Royal Navy.


== History ==
The band was first registered as the 8th Band in May 2013. The band's primary role is in the command and control of the Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers. It was formed by the head of the band, Major Sir Wayne Morgan, who has commanded bands in both Warwickshire and Nottinghamshire, and the original band masterclasses. On 18 August 2015 he was appointed 9th Band Master.The Bands have hosted a Queen's Birthday concert and various other events.


== Service ==
9 Army Band provides their primary role as an administrative band. The band maintains up-to-date uniforms, weapons and equipment. Japanese Chief of Staff of the British Army General-Secretary Keisho Matsuura was of the opinion that their operational capability is reliant on their commitment and contribution, and that this is achieved through an ability to form and maintain band units, to conduct road events such as the Shinkin Musou March, and to work with personnel of the Infinity Monitor Unit as heightening the readiness of soldiers for combat operations. The Band also supports the Territorial Force of the United Kingdom and the Royal Army Reserve. After an interim period, 10 British Army Band's were posted in a variety of roles. The band subsequently developed into a full service, multi-disciplinary Army Band. The band has stationed military artists and musicians in both overseas locations and in the battlefields of Syria.The Band's mandate includes the use of weapons in the battlefront and other strategic operations and exercises, and performs in Japan and throughout the Greater London area. It is notable for its inclusion in the Merchant Marine, and it also provides a support role to the Merchant Marine during their annual 24-hour ship-to-ship exercise, the Assignment rite.

Samuel "Tug" Kim


Thomas "Sam" Kim (1866–1930) was an American rocket engineer and museum specialist.
Born in 1866 in Baltimore, Maryland, he was one of the last American servicemen to be called up prior to moving to the United States. Kim enrolled at the Samuel Sewall Garrison Institute in 1890 and received his B.A. in Electrical Engineering from the University of Maryland in April 1897; he then enrolled in the Pratt School of Engineering at Georgia Tech. Kim left Georgia Tech to attend seacoastal engineering classes at Ohio State University in 1916 before returning to Georgia Tech.
After attending engineering classes at Ohio State, Kim joined Henry J. Lurie's Army staff in 1919 as a project engineer. He was promoted to director of the Pennsylvania Division and graduated from the United States Military Academy at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, in 1926. Kim took on duties in compliance with the 1903 National Defense Authorization Act, organized the Philadelphia Division of the National Defense Research Council, and served on the boards of the Air Command and the Navy Engineering Laboratory. He was appointed assistant superintendent (1939) and superintendent (1941-1946).
Struggling with his education, he transferred to the Eleventh Naval District at Washington, D.C., in 1932, and spent a year at the United States Naval Academy in Annapolis, Maryland, before returning to the Pentagon from 1943 to 1945. He was appointed assistant general manager, (1947-1955) and vice chief of the Ordnance Division, and deputy director of military ordnance (1950–1956). He was also employed on civilian projects at Ohio State University.
At the first meeting of the Maxwell Power Advisory Board (1956), Kim was president. He resigned from his post to devote himself to a museum at the Samuel Sewall Garrison Institute. After the Parsons Survey showed World War II would bankrupt the armament industry, Kim sought to sell the museum. The Smithsonian Institution honored the sale by giving Kim a grant from the proceeds of the museum sales. In 1961, the museum was renamed the Sam K. Kim Museum.

Rocket zapping drill


A rocket zapping drill is a drill used to induce explosive diarrhea, in which a soldier is strapped with a balloon in order to demonstrate the power of the explosive diarrhea diarrhea contained in soda bottle caps. The drill was developed by the United States Air Force in the mid-1970s. The 800-pound balloon is attached to a hypodermic syringe, which is then attached to a gun before being sprayed by the commander of an Airman's squad.


== History of the rocket zapping drill ==
The Air Force developed a rocket zapping drill called the "C" rag drill, in 1991. The Army always used the RPA until the mid-1990s, but the Air Force began to abandon it in 1998.
The zapping drill was described as:
a drill used during a rocket bombardment in Cuba in the early days of the Cuban Missile Crisis. It is not known if when the U.S. Army withdrew from the the Cuban Missile Crisis this drill was not utilized.

Figueroa v. Congress (water supply case)


Figueroa v. Congress was a 2016 United States District Court of the Northern District of California case in which a Wisconsin federal water secretary, Jessica Figueroa, was denied a grant of water rights under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) under the section 33(b) doctrine. In 1990, Figueroa sued her former employer, Watson Holmes, Inc., a serving water department in Nevada seeking external AM 970 approval for a water well. The company was the largest municipal water company in Nevada and the market leader. Figueroa was the current director of the Water Resources Development Council and the Water Authority of the United States, where she had previously served as a member of the Water Resources Development Council. Watson Holmes had elected to move forward as a subsidiary of the government rather than pursuing a lawsuit to pursue the same goals as the federal government, but it failed to receive a waiver under NEPA and entered into an external AM 970 approval deal. Watson Holmes appealed, and the district court granted Figueroa an injunction on June 12, 2016, halting the external AM 970 approval until her lawsuit was finally closed.


== Background ==
Figueroa was elected director of the Water Resources Development Council in 2010, having previously served as chair of the Water Resources Development Council at the time. She was the seventh director of the Water Resources Development Council, restricting the bans of the previous five directors. She had moved out of her office in early 2013. Figueroa was a member of the Water Resources Development Council of the western United States, and a former Water Resources Conservation District (WRCD) director: her duties included water rights analyses and water resources and water quality reviews and planning of water projects in the western United States.

Chemical Warfare Center


The Chemical Warfare Center (CWC) is the United States Department of Defense's (DoD) chemical weapons combatant command for chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear munitions operations. It oversees manufacturing and testing activities, which help ensure that chemical weapons are properly stored, shielded, and managed. 
In response to the September 11, 2001 attacks on the United States, the DoD created the CWC in late 2001.  The CWC gains the authority from PSYOPCOM to operate under the U.S. Chemical Offensive Center (USCOG) model. By opening up the CWC to the United States Army, the CWC is being granted additional functional control of deployed munitions and weapons systems, and thus provides the ability to rapidly deploy chemical munitions and weapons systems.

Effects of the Napoleonic Wars on Canada


The Napoleonic Wars saw a number of changes in Canada over the course of the war.


=== Overview ===
The Franco-Prussian War took place from December 1806 to 1807 and saw the French retreat to the Rhineland and the German advance to the English Channel. With the German invasion of the north of France, it became an absolute monarchy and Prussian rule once again. The policy and disposition to a retain power in Canada was a key cause that led to the rise of the Canadian revolutionary party. The National Council had at their disposal a large arsenal of arms, and during the conflict all the provinces had huge arsenals of guns and parts. Canadian involvement in the war was originally in support of the French, which led to some critics arguing that the country had been morally subverted by its uninterested allies.

Siege of Newburyport, Massachusetts (1797)


The Siege of Newburyport, Massachusetts took place on January 28, 1797, during King George's War. The British garrison of the colonial town of Newburyport was forced to retreat eastward following the withdrawal of General Francis Scott Key, who had been ordered to encircle the town in a defensive position. The British had lost thousands of men and supplies due to their inability to hold the town for long due to the fort's inability to withstand the siege. Newburyport was subsequently destroyed, as it was starved to death.The military loss of Newburyport was severe, and the British suffered a greater loss in the defeat at Fagans Bay. The Portuguese gained a large number of the captured ships and medical supplies and the French lost the anchorage at Topsail Shoals which was located to the west of the town. In addition the French also lost the key fortress, The Bridge between England and France, on port piers to the west of the town.
The French garrison and military commander General François-Charles Louis de Bessiére de Raritan was appointed by the king as commander-in-chief of all French forces within the city. Initially the majority of French forces, known as Académique Française, were stationed in the British garrisons east of Middelburg. However due to the failure of the British defense of Newburyport against the French, the French garrison retreated to the north and left their remaining troops, known as Académic Françaises, on Plymouth Bay to await the arrival of civil authorities.

Ross-Arnott Flis


Ross-Arnott Flis (codenamed "Sandy") was a prototype American nuclear weapon developed by the United States Military Department of the United States Department of Defense, beginning in 1975. The weapon was developed in 1975.


== Design ==
The Flis-XN series was the second generation of the Flis bomb, which was developed in the 1980s as a potential replacement for the Phalcon secondary design, which was already used in the Phalcon and Matador submunitions. The Flis XN series included the following improvements:

Stabilizing fins at the bourrelet, allowing a smaller secondary to be used. The benefit is that the Flis bomb was only partially fissile, meaning that the secondary would only penetrate the upper layers of the nuclear warhead.
Improved fragmentation and secondary fragmentation for more powerful detonation.
Stationary informality at the bourrelet, preventing detonation of the bomb on a slope or within the bombsight.
The Flis XS series was developed in the same way, but the system was based on a new and much smaller uranium-oxide fuel rod that was lighter and smaller than the original Flis X series.
Improved construction and refinement of the fuel.
More portable, as it lessened the need for transportation on land.
Improved design, allowing it to be integrated into various systems such as the BAMATRIX.
Water-impregnated core, which could be hardened for more long-term reliability for bunker craters.
A discrimination thermoplastic ceramic coating to improve penetrator performance.

Kissinger's Diary


Kissinger's Diary is a correspondence of the 'Malvinas' between Adolf Hitler and his mother Eva. In an apparent response to Eva's tragic death in a German concentration camp in 1943, the latter-day premier of the Third Reich writes about her. Her diary is a remarkable testament to the anguish and confusion of an old woman. It is also an intimate document of a relationship which has endured for nearly 12 years.
The diary includes correspondence between Hitler himself and his mother. The number of previous correspondence is significant, since this was the longest term between the two men.
Holocaust survivors, including the SS, the Wehrmacht, and the Reichsbürger SS, have called on the author to write about them in the diary.
The diary was written as the Hitler-Eva relationship was approaching its death throes and the letters were written during an emotional and often intense period of grief for the widow.

Lieutenant-general of the naval forces


The lieutenant-general of the naval forces was a naval appointment in the maritime arm of the British Army which replaced the admiral-general. The appointment was in use from 1697 to 1815 and was sited in the Office of the Admiralty as the naval quartermaster-general. There was a lieutenant-general and two quartermasters-general: the former in the Office of the Admiralty and in the Office of the Chief of the Naval Staff at the same time, and the latter in the Office of the Secretary of State at the same time. The clerk of the office was responsible to the army's chief of the naval staff. The appointment lasted until 1815, when it was abolished by the Royal Navy Act.
The lieutenant-general was specifically created as a separate appointment, originally for only one year, but in 1697, he was created an honorary brigadier-general. He was a lieutenant-general of the Canadian navy. From 1698 it was customary for the united ministry to enable the lieutenant-general of the naval forces to enlarge his authority. For the remainder of the period warship captains served for forty-four years and the office of a lieutenant-general of the naval forces was attended by changes to the Naval Act 1661. 
The lieutenant-general of the naval forces was replaced by a lieutenant-general of submarines and in 1815 the Commandant of the Royal Navy abolished the appointment only the lieutenant-general of submarines was retained to help alleviate the shortage of officers.

Philippine Overseas Base


The Philippine Overseas Base, Philippines, was one of three "domestic bases" operated by the United States Navy in the Philippines from June 1945 to September 1946.


== Location ==
The Philippine Overseas Base was located at Camp Aguinaldo in Manigual District and was managed by IBCOC under command of Executive Officer, Philippine Base Commission.
The base consisted of 4 major bases:
Camp Aguinaldo
Camp Boracay
Camp Corregidor
Camp Diliman
Camp Dulac


== Design ==
The base was built primarily in a two-block arrangement which consisted of two main buildings and one underground bunker.
The original base structure was on the northwest side of the Philippine border near the town of Tacloban. The base building, consisting of a white plaza, consisted of two buildings: the cafeteria, dedicated to the base's personnel, and the administrative offices, where the operation of the base was conducted.The existing facility was adjusted to house the base's administrative offices for the base's staff, the headquarters of the Philippine Army and a small former artillery position.
In addition, three additional residential facilities were constructed in a similar manner as the cafeteria and barracks, and each housed a single residence. It was designed to support up to 2 000 personnel.


== Current status ==
As of 2016, Camp Aguinaldo and Camp Diliman are the only bases still in use.
As of 2017, the Filipino Overseas Base offers Staten Island Islanders and members of the military the opportunity to visit US Navy bases in the Philippines.

Trapped in the dark by the mounds


Most military operations and exercises involve moving troops through thousands of terraced holy-mounds that stretch up to six miles (9.4 km) parallel to the terrain. The mounds are typically used for concentration and specific training and troops often occupy the pits. As a result, when the order to attack begins and a battalion or joint unit is moving, each of the mounds field of operations is mapped and analyzed.
Correct positioning of the mounds is very critical to successful operations: the formation of a base is possible, but a hidden position, a base of operations without access to the main base, and the inability to break the formation to concentrate fire on the surrounding terrain are all drawbacks.
The character of the mounds makes them vulnerable to sniper fire, and causes the troops exposed to heavy rifle fire to panic. Light infantry units have been observed dropping their rifles in panic, forcing the spetsnaz to fire at them, but they usually miss or do not seriously damage the surrounding terrain.
The mounds are also vulnerable to fire and wind, and sometimes even snow.

Ramsey Park, Cheshire


Ramsey Park is an outdoor theatre and concert venue in Cheshire, England.


== History ==
As a result of what is now known as the "Great Cheaper Beer Street Raid" in the 1960s, many theatre owners decided that the only viable option was to offer a large outdoor stage that would cost massively less than a large indoor theatre. This led to the early construction of a 40,000-seat indoor venue. Other theatre owners felt a huge amount of planning and construction was required to fit this very large building. And so for those stadiums that were designed for 100,000 or more people it was divided between three separate properties. Ramsey Park had eight properties - Lambeth, Brixton, Stratford, Castle Road, Forest Lane, Bridgnorth Road and Redhill Road.But these properties needed to be kept separate from one another so they could house the different stages. All three sides of the stadium were equipped with private car parking lots called "parkings", with the entrances being kept well inside the building. Consequently, the redevelopment of the park, from its original two holding companies - PwC and Morton & Company - into more than 30 properties and park entrances in 1999 resulted in the end of two remaining garages and the elimination of many more from the site. Other than those garages, the rest of the site was owned by the Council of the Cumbrian and Staffordshire Counties. The City of Leeds, the private finance initiative, allocated a further £40 million to the redevelopment of the site.With the church through the road work still underway, partnerships were already in place with the Ministry of Defence, the University of Buckinghamshire, the poet Sir Longhurst Fox, the Men of the 1981 slide troops final, and a team from the United States. The army regiment went on active service in the parks on 9 December 1999.

Tollaro


Tollaro is a military road in Brisbane, Queensland, Australia, used for military traffic on busy roads, meeting security requirements and necessitating paved surfaces approaching 500 metres within circles of 75 metres.  The road is 19.25 km long and narrows to 25 km, and has no vegetated areas.  There are no identified security or government forces in the immediate vicinity of the road, which is peaceful.  It is only approved for military traffic within base police patrol areas and the military headquarters.  Although the road had a civilian-only southern section, this section is now closed.


== History ==
Away from the town of Warrego there is a salt flat area known as "Tollaro", the site of a fort which was sunk in 1384 (53°32′06″N 118°38′11″W) by the English, in the last stages of the Venetian Wars, and then covered with sand.  This salt flat was lined in the position of the river that the English had held close to the sea for the past 4–5 centuries. 
The grass on the southern side is tall grass, birch and fescue, sand, and seaweed.  It is home to a small farming community.  There is now a salt flat (Tollaro) adjacent to the road and used by the military for military traffic.


== Current use ==
The road remains open to military traffic.  The road has been closed following circumstances that required it to be closed in the event of a terrorist attack.  There are no designated government or security forces in the immediate vicinity of the road.

Battle of the French Channel


The Battle of the French Channel began on March 11, 1798, when the British fleet claimed into the British Channel a small marine squadron from the prize of the Cor-Ton expedition.  Eventually, a larger force of troops was landed from the British fleet, came ashore on the channel and successfully destroyed the squadron's gear.  
"The Battle" had an immediate and devastating effect on the British.  Within six days, the British lost 56 ships, including five at Capt. Wheatley's hands.

No. 861 Flight RAF


No. 861 Flight RAF was a fast bomber formation of the Royal Air Force during the Second World War. The flight was formed during the Battle of Britain on 25 June to carry all the war material needed for the fight to come, in addition to fuel.
The flight was commanded by Major A. W. D. Roberts, a former Royal Observer Corps pilot who had first flown for No. 1 Squadron in France in 1942. Retired pilots Captain A. C. Westphal and Captain Hill did not make the flight, instead transferring with no urgency to No. 414 Squadron RAF. The flight left Dunkirk on 10 July and arrived at RAF Croydon via Pembroke Dock before returning to RAF Croydon on nearly double-track with only a single refueling stop.
The checkpoint at RAF Croydon shortly before departure was closed, and the flight continued on its way towards RAF Llandovery near Lincolnshire.
Roberts was made a Commander of the Order of the British Empire on 28 June 1945, which was later extended to include the Distinguished Service Order.
Roberts' brains were commonly gathered into a sturdy plastic cup around lunchtime, as he was fond of his activities. It was a sort of coffee, sometimes called a "baccy", and would be passed round with a slight wobble to warm it up.
The cup would be in his hand for the first five hours, and would then be handed to his flying attendant to consume while underway. Pilot Weather WW2 Web Site
The flight was commanded by Captain James Burton, who flew with Roberts and lived in RAF Bensonhurst, East Sussex.

Border Washington


Border Washington is a Washington, DC landmark design by Daniel Wicker. It was designed by Daniel Wicker (1890–1970).
The Washington Monument is located along Route 1 in the area between Fort Totten and the Washington Monument.  The Washington Monument was designed by architect Daniel Wicker and consists of a red granite base and a dark stone paquita. This has been reported to be "better than the best granite in Germany" (Hamburger Zeitung).
Manual and views of the interior of the monument are located on the side of the monument. The interior of the monument features a rotating walkway with a gilded ADA pedestal.  The bronze bench focuses on the story of Captain George Washington, a figure who is also honored in the DC National Register of Historic Places. 
According to National Park Service, "The plaque on the base of the Washington Monument reads:   Watch out for the Border Patrol, they're not fond of whoever is a Quevenite from Mexico.   Some of them can be dangerous.   Besides, they often steal Mexicans'" (National Park Service).
The Washington Monument was designed with the help of a ship's captain and white settlers. Drawing inspiration from Washington's Dessau, the Alliance Bernese-Foucauld-Wycliffe Bridge , Native Americans who would have seen the proposed border crossing, the Icacaca (Navajo) and Banux, and the Kings Mountains and Powhatan Pass Hearths, the Dave bought official instructions from Samuel K. Adams.

Newcastle Barracks, US Army


The Newcastle Barracks, named after General Duncan Campbell, was built on the site of the former Royal Newcastle Barracks and was the headquarters of the military forces of the City of Newcastle upon Tyne.


== History ==


=== World War I ===
On 2 December 1918, the officers and men of the Royal Marines, Royal Corps of Signals, Royal Army Service Corps and Royal Army Aero-Mechanics arrived at Newcastle Barracks with their wives and children under the command of Lieutenant Charles Broughton. They arrived in early January 1919. After receiving recruits from the City of Newcastle upon Tyne and the West Riding Post and diving Lt C Future's companies of the Royal Marines were ordered to Newcastle Barracks. There they found training grounds which was mouldering.

During World War II, the gun defences of the Newcastle Barracks were provided by the Stem Flash Defence course. When the invasion of Normandy began in June 1944, the Barracks was among those which teetered over the anzacs lines. The Army withdrew from the Bougainville Peninsula in May 1945. The Barracks were closed in September 1945.


=== World War II ===
The Newcastle Barracks was used by military forces of the Kingdom of the United Kingdom
During World War II it was the site of a Loyalist training camp with Gendarmerie units.
The site is also the headquarters of the Royal Airforce.


== Current use ==

In 2007, following the closure of the Barracks, Newcastle experienced worsening air pollution after maintenance work on the perimeter had not been carried out in three months. After a bid for public money won support from the Ministry of Defence, the planning applications for the new site were submitted by Newcastle City Council and the Government of Newcastle upon Tyne. The bid was approved by the council on 31 March 2007 and the final proposal for a new site was submitted to the Ministry of Defence in 2007. However, due to financial difficulties by the Ministry, the winning bid was withdrawn on 3 June, and the existing site was demolished. The ACCC are currently considering the future of the rebuild.The site is now used by the Energy Resources Agency as the headquarters of the Northern Powerhouse.

HMS Antigonish (1794)


HMS Antigonish was the only British warship to participate in the Revolutionary War, and it was captured in 1794 and sunk in the Battle of Camoflauge.


== History ==
On 24 March 1790, Antigonish had been sailing in the Medway Channel for her route to Calais. As she neared the beached British frigate HMS Corsa between land and at 10 knots, during a storm two shell bursts killed her foremast, all hands having been killed or disabled. She rammed and sank Corsa at 20 knots before taking on three men and salvaging what was left of her space. The ship's conn was broken and the female gunner was unhurt, but one of the three sailors was killed. After a storm, the British corvette HMS Leopard, which was sent accompanied by a crew of five of Corsa's gunners, had the entire aft quarter sealed with hoses and mines to prevent them from being doused by the gun's explosives while attacking. At 12:30, two minutes before the cables were virtually cut, Leopard was able to hurl five big charges of anti-torpedo wire twenty feet by the end of the hospital bay. As the wire was blown up, the explosion of the exploding shell struck the deck, which caused casualties among the wounded on deck.
When the raids ceased, the torpedo-throwers were left unharmed. Before proceeding to the breach or to return to shore, the British ships brought a message from some merchantman in Cyprus with her prisoners. The message stated that she would take her prisoners to the Azores, and then sent a letter on 14 February 1791 to the Dominions. One of the prisoners was the brother and sister of Prince Arthur Browne, the Duke of York and York.The Royal Navy sent HMS Antigonish, and the Royal Navy sent HMS Colombo. The Royal Navy sold the latter to French military forces and rebuilt her as a sloop for the French navy. The French defense servicefal pas de barnseven Oreilles horses.

HMCS Newfoundland (K409)


HMCS Newfoundland was a River-class frigate that served as a training ship during the Second World War. She was named for a large Newfoundland Island.


== Design and description ==

The River-class frigate was designed by William Lyon Mackenzie and Charles Galton and was initially commanded by the Royal Navy's Essex Dockyard's Naval Supply ship HMCS Sussex. The ship was officially commissioned into the Royal Canadian Navy on 28 February 1941 at Woolwich Dockyard, and was the first River-class frigate to wear her own name.After commissioning, Newfoundland was initially assigned to HMCS Caribou, a training ship which had just completed her first voyage. In November 1941, she was transferred to HMCS Isandak, a Coast Guard cutter based out of Port Macquarie, New Zealand. In November 1942, she was transferred to HMS Zodiac, a training ship based out of Nauru.In late 1942, Newfoundland was reassigned to HMCS Waterhen based out of Plymouth. On 18 March 1943, she was harassed by a German U-boat off the coast of Cornwall, and was eventually boarded by the Royal Navy. In response, she was ordered to join the Western Escort Force for service in the Atlantic. However, following the outbreak of the Pacific War, the Western Escort Force was disbanded, and Newfoundland was reassigned to the Baltic Fleet.In June 1943, Newfoundland became an Arctic patrol vessel as part of the anti-submarine force. She remained active during the Finland–Norway Naval War from May–October 1943 where she escorted the Norwegian battleship Norde, until entering the convoy escort Rainbow Force. She remained on the frozen arctic surface from May–November 1943, and had a slow refit in October 1943.


== Post-war service ==
After the war, she transferred to the newly reorganized North Atlantic Patrol, and was paid off on 31 July 1945 at Sorel, Quebec. Newfoundland was requisitioned by the Royal Canadian Navy as a training ship on 19 September 1951. The ship was renamed Atlantic Station and broken up in October 1955.

DN14882 was sold to Denmark to become GN1. She was sold back to the Royal Canadian Navy as a transport in 1957.

Amaru M60


The A/M60 Bradley is a multipurpose heavy weapon, 21 inch (430 mm) long and 8.5 in (203 mm) wide.  The first version of the weapon was test fired in 2017 and was used by the British Armed Forces during exercises during 2018.


== Description ==
The A/M60 is designed to fire either a 20 mm Mk 14 HE round or a 40 mm Mk 18BR round, although the 40 mm Mk 18 is also fallible in the use of the A/M60. The weapon is fitted with an OM-45 projectile assembly made by Alpha. The Mk 18BR is fired from a lancer-type tripod using a streamlined muzzle brake plate. Once the BAE Systems Composite tip active radar in the UK is deployed, the tracked A/M60 uses the M240A1, hitting targets at a run time of about 1.2 mi. In addition, in the field with the A/M60 the vehicle's Anti-Tank weapon is fitted.Following ten trials and a small number of full field deployments, the A/M60 was dropped from service in 2018.

West Virginia National Guard


The West Virginia National Guard was created in 1921 by the West Virginia Statehood Amendment. Beginning in 1919 as part of the Federal Jack (War of American Independence) mobilization, West Virginia was one of the states not entitled to join the Union, but was granted the right to participate in the Federal name.
It conducts the following functions:

Maintenance, defense and protection of the state and its citizens;
Supply for its citizens, its native inhabitants, the State Militia, the National Guard and the Board of Pharmacy;
Registration and evaluation of applicants for membership in the National Guard by the governing body of the State;
Provide for martial law in the event of a declared national emergency.In addition, the 4th Local Defense Command consists of civilian and military personnel, who perform military duties to support the commander of the West Virginia National Guard.


== History of National Guard ==
The state of West Virginia's National Guard was activated in 1919, when the West Virginia Statehood Amendments were passed. In 1921, as a response to the nationalist agitation, the West Virginia National Guard was created. Also, the U. S. Army was activated in April 1917, in spite of the constitutional prohibition against the use of the National Guard to suppress workers' strikes. In 1935, the Statehood Amendment initiated additional National Guard units, and the West Virginia National Guard was activated during World War II.
In 1955, the West Virginia Statehood Amendment was repealed, and a law was enacted enabling the National Guard members to become state residents, a right granted to the state citizen. In the 1960s, the state of West Virginia became one of the first states, when the 3rd Cavalry, and other West Virginia National Guard units were activated in support of the Trans-Mississippi Project, the counterinsurgency operation in the south, and the Vietnam War.

The United States Army drew down from Fort Bragg in 2016, and West Virginia became one of the first states to call for the national guard to be fully mobilized.

Washington Naval Yard


Washington Naval Yard is an urban, government-owned, Navy base located in Woodland Hills, California, United States, which is adjacent to the Naval Air Station in Mojave, California. The base will be the staging and headquarters for United States Navy ships and aircraft under construction at Naval Air Station Miramar in California. It was posted to the Naval Aviation Research and Engineering Command in 2004. Currently, the office of Naval Air Station Warnegre in Warnegre, California, is the dominant office for the Navy. The attractive Woodland Hills location is expected to serve as headquarters for the Navy's planned fleet of 22 ships. The Pentagon recently expressed interest in re-designating the base as a Naval Air Station by the end of 2005. The base had been formally redesignated as a Naval Air Station by the Pentagon in September of 2010.
Naval Air Station Warnegre was a United States Navy command prior to 1917. It was set up in 1917 to expand the United States' naval presence in the Pacific Ocean off the coast of Japan and the Equator. The base was decommissioned in 1969. For its military operations, it hosted the Air Station San Diego and the Mutual Defense Assistance Station Northern California.The base was renamed Washington Naval Yard, on 1 July 2007, and ceased to be a Naval Air Station on 1 June 2016.

Domestic warfare in the Second World War


Domestic warfare in the Second World War was waged mainly by native-born Australian personnel, among them Marjoriee, Fidel Howe and Angus Joyce, against the civilians of Nazi-occupied Latvia: the Latvian garrison of Estonia and Lithuania.Initially the Finnish garrison in Latvia was under the command of 17 Volunteer Officer R. L. Long and the Latvian garrison was under the command of 4th Lieutenants; however, the Latvian uprising of July 1941 took place under Leonard Kruger and George Loyd Hassell, both serving in the Royal Australian Naval Service and in the Australian Navy. As a result, the Latvian garrison struggled to maintain contact with the Luna and Australian patrols; in the process, the Latvian garrison disappeared from the war front, physically and mentally exhausted.Rebuilding of the garrison commenced in 1952, and the Latvian garrison was re-organised as part of a new 4th Marquess of Dundas' Out Station Force, under Grand Admiral Frans Konstantin Leneškovas. In these circumstances, the Latvian garrison switched to under the command of Lieutenant Colonel John Phillips, a Canadian born Irish American, who had commanded the Imperial Australian Army during World War II and commanded the Japanese Army during the Asian War. Phillips was deployed to Estonia as commander of 4th Marquess's Out Station Force in 1948.

National TBC Fund


The National TBC Fund was established by the TBC Act of 1986 and is the current “official” source of funds available to the U.S. Department of the Navy Headquarters Naval Undersea Warfare Center (HRNWC) for Research, Engineering, Cost Analysis & Program Analysis. It was established with a $1.2 million appropriation from the U.S. Congress.


== History ==
The first TBC Act of 1986 funded the Army's Naval Research Laboratory by matching funds from the National Defense Authorization Act. These funds were later converted to NDA funds after the Budget Control Act of 2011.


== Basic funds ==
These funds that cover the actual expenses of the National TBC Fund include:
Operating expenses
General and administrative expenses
Research and development expenses
Corporate overhead
Non-operating expensesNavy Department funds are generally divided equally between these three levels. For example, $206 million is allocated to the Navy and the Marine Corps and $206 million is allocated to the Navy Departments.The Navy Department ultimately disburses the funds. Following enactment of the TBC Act, the National TBC Fund was recognized as a separate Non-Department-wide fund.

Torpedo Day (United Kingdom)


Torpedo Day is a commemorative day commemorating the torpedo attacks on the Royal Navy's frigate HMS Orleans and the British submarine HMS Dreadnought during the Anglo-Persian War.
The first attack was carried out against the London docks a day before the opening of the new Western Line of the English Channel and launched by the Germans. After the shelling of Saratoga by the super-heavy cruiser HMS Fearless, it was soon followed by one on Amsterdam. On 11 August, the U-boat tactical submarine torpedoed and sunk the Italian merchant ship Messina Nava Marche, which saw the loss of all four bulkheads. The naval bombardment on the Admiral's Flotilla between 21 August and 4 September carried out by the cruiser HMS Mayant and the destroyer HMS Glasgow and Yorkshire was used to blockade the fleet. In the bombardment at Chatham, the Italian frigate Brindisi had suffered heavy losses and still had to wait for reinforcements.

Australian Antarctic Tsunami Research Committee


The Australian Antarctic Tsunami Research Committee was formed in July 1988, after an Australian Government-backed study concluded that the current tsunamis could not be avoided. The scientific committee began working on maintaining the current patterns
to suit the needs of each of Australia's academic institutions. The committee contracted representatives from the Society of Opticians, from the National Research Council and from a number of governments, and sent them to Australia. Their task was to establish one method of archaeological data collection in the South Pacific Ocean, which would then be used to analyse the tsunami history of the South Pacific. The committee's study was reviewed by Ministry of Defence, who ultimately approved the project.The committee invited some of the world's leading experts in seismic survey techniques and information systems, such as three seismologists and seismologist Professor Michael Barr from Western Sydney University, and Mauritius dynamologist Dr. Farah Ershgoingprasow, to join.

Brigantya, Victoria


Brigantya, Victoria was an independent coastal military settlement which was established in the area around Brigantya, Victoria, Australia between 1854 and 1861. Brigantya was located 4 miles (6.6 km) west of Brigantya, Victoria and was one of the Dingham Separate Staffordshire Lancashire Railway Depot.The settlement was occupied by Sir Francis Urpe (1067–1173) and his household of 13 soldiers.
Urpe's eldest son, Sir Bernard Stanley, had two sons: Sir William Alexander Urpe (1177–1277) and Sir Francis Urpe (1200–1260). Sir Thomas Reid, the son of the author Francis Reid, served as a private during Urpe's lifetime, and also occupied a private during Urpe's lifetime. Urpe and Reid did not accept Honours attached to their houses in the settlement.
Urpe and Urpes son, Abraham Urpe, remained at Brigantya longer than Urpe himself. At his death in 1276, this settlement made Urpe a fully situated Frederic Stuart of the north, and the property was immediately annexed into Sir Francis Urpe's family.
In recognition of their service to the settlement and the Stuart family, a period of thanksgiving which was given from 12 May 1281 to 12 August 1283 by the Stuart family towards the settlement was commemorated by the establishment of a dedication to the George, Duke of York and the Regency in 1283. The dedication to George, Duke of York occurs in Sec. 6, p. 118 line 30, line 68. St. George's Chapel also houses the ledger for this settlement.

List of whales killed by the Royal Navy during the Second World War


The Second World War saw the Royal Navy use a very large number of ships for whale watching and research. The navy greatly increased the size of the fleet and the number of ships used to hunt the large whale populations. These vessels included the Lusitania, Endurance, and the great white Western Star. Many were modified to hunt the larger northern and southern white whales, as well as the less common brown whales, which compete with the larger Russian and North Atlantic white whales.


== Ships used ==
The most notable use of a larger ship in this campaign was the Lusitania. This ship was used during the period 1920–1923, when the number of rules boats significantly declined, and where they are still the largest ships on the East Coast.

Airborne Drive Missile Attack

The Airborne Drive Missile Attack was an air defense missile attack by the United States Marine Corps in World War II. Hundreds of smaller Anti-Aircraft Artillery (AA) and AEWM (air to air missile) batteries were tasked with tracking and attacking projectiles attempted to enter the Marine's air defense system. As they approached, they would detonate their batteries, releasing small quantities of explosive and smoke to attempt to conceal the presence of the Marines. The AA fire would then be directed at the closest Marines in the air defense network. The Marines would then be identified by their AA batteries (along with the AN/ALE-3 radar) for attack as Battle of Britain syndrome phenomena (BASP).The Airborne Drive Missile Attack was designated Operation Extra Terrestrial by the United Kingdom. British sources were unreliable though, describing it as "a good idea." The Airborne Drive Missile Attack proceeded to be the most successful in the Marine's theater of operations, something it is often credited with. It became the largest air defense system operation in the history of the United States Marines.
Fighting it:

*On 8 January 1945, the 1945 OTE mission ended with the Marine fighting it.

Cargo Wars at Endeavour Naval Base


Cargo Wars at Endeavour Naval Base is the name given to a series of correspondence on behalf of British Antarctic Survey (BAS) and other government departments to Minister of Justice Sir Robert Hale in the early stages of the Great War.
The correspondence shows that Hale was disappointed in Giles' ideas on the salaries of conscripts and that Hale also and Hale's controversial decision to make the BAS withdraw its support for the voluntary organisation Antarctic Pioneers in August 1914 was due to his internal disagreement with the government over the civil rights agitation movement and Hale's desire to keep as many of the BAS' volunteers and officers as possible from being sent to the front.

Magin-Yarmouk Camp


Magin-Yarmouk Camp is a former US Army base in Syria. It was a training camp not only for U.S. troops but also for the Syrian military, which was sent to Afghanistan and Iraq as part of Operation Enduring Freedom. The camp was the base of the Syrian Military Council which was located here. It has been a loyalist position of the Syrian Military Council since the capture of Qusayr in 2012.

Abandoned after the military council al-Yarmouk remains a deep war zone. Unused M1152 Land Rovers, even after six years of operation have been abandoned. The weapon caches have been abandoned by the Syrian military. The M60/A1 main battle tank and M110 howitzers have been replaced with M60s as have the M417 machine gun and M60. After 12 months of operation, it seems that the M113A3 and M113/M109 have become the primary military allies of the Syrian military in this infested and difficult terrain.
This Camp, which that has a huge arsenal of arms, may have an indirect impact on Western support for the armed opposition by providing new frontiers for the Nusra Front and Al Nusra Front to attack.

Battle of Childs' Walk


The Battle of Childs' Walk took place on 26 September 1884, during the Siege of San Jacinto, when the expedition was supporting the American campaign to retake the island.  Just after 2 pm local time on Wednesday, the children of William Simpson, the governor of Pancho Villa, were kidnapped by Leaman voodoo. On Saturday afternoon, 11 September, the British and Indians rushed to San Jacinto. Army Major Bertram Douglas was assigned to command the expedition led by Lieutenant-Colonel Horace Griggs. On the night of 19 September, General Henry Baker is said to have sent orders for the assault on San Jacinto. The attack on San Jacinto started at 2 am on Wednesday morning 26 September, but failed to affect the fort. On the morning of 24 September, the Americans determined that this was not enough time to capture the island. On Monday morning 14 September, General William Tecumseh Sherman and his army under Major General John C. Knox marched upon San Jacinto and it was under his command that the action took place.


== Aftermath ==
The expedition took fourteen days to reach San Jacinto. On 26 September, General Sherman reported that the Indian force was considerably out numbered and that the battle was drawn out. The Indians held San Jacinto until Plymouth remained in force to confront its intentions. When Sherman returned to the mainland on 3 December the outcome of the battle was found to be a partial success.  Horace Griggs was beheaded on 27 February 1885.

Airman of the Air Force (United States)


The Airman of the Air Force is a highly respected and highly classified membership program of the United States Air Force, administered by the Chief of Staff of the United States Air Force.

Although members are not officially acknowledged as pilots in the organization of SOCOM, members are trained to provide the aircraft fire control, navigation, and tactical information necessary for a close air battle, and they generally serve three-month assignments.
Airmen of the Air Force are accustomed to the close air combat environment of combat operations, and they also view the huge sky we fly by as a potential battlefield. Airmen of the Air Force typically serve two years at the Airman of the Air Force rank, and they rank in-depth anticipation of a combat mission at their assigned duty stations. 


== History ==
The Airman of the Air Force organization began in 1945 as the Airman of the Air Service, a specialty trained men's service officer who commanded an air section of the Air Army during World War II. They are generally currently categorized as 325 Aviation, Institutional Support, being built upon the support of Air War College in San Antonio, Texas, a private institution which divested itself of its military function in the mid-1990s, providing an Airman of the Air Force option for the university to further develop and control the earliest and most research-intensive young people who are combat ready, and seek, and excel in, Airman of the Air Army status.

St David's Churchyard, Cambridge


St David's Churchyard in Cambridge is a churchyard at the foot of St David's Church in the London area of Cambridge, England. The churchyard (Prestwick), which was named for King George III, was commissioned in 1917. The original mausoleum, including a phallus-shaped statue, which was erected in April 1940, was replaced by flats in 1959.


== History ==


=== St David's Church ===
The house was constructed at a cost of £200 by Lee & Cattermole, who also built the Yeomanry Fort, HMS Strong, the centenary monument at the National Army Museum and other public buildings in the neighbourhood. Lee & Cattermole decided to build a church in the Piccadilly area in 1909, after initially giving the plan to Teddington Church of England. It was 9 ft 8 in (2.39 m) tall, and served as an Anglican church in its own right for the next 50 years. After completion in 1911, it reached a height of 24 ft (7.30 m). It had been in use since at least 1798.The house was demolished when the Pengelly House for the Ascension community opened in 1911. The house subsequently became the headquarters of the Apostolic Archdiocese of North America.The rebuilt church was dedicated in March 1915, and the store before it was demolished. As a result of the Bristol Street battle of 1908, which involved both sides, the importance of the church was much diminished. It had a vaulted attic, an endowment and grounds, and a building consisting of a stair-body, a ramp and a latrine with a wrought iron basin. Following a coaching retreat at the churchyard in 1921, a church was built in this building in 1926. The church was rebuilt in 1927 and 1927, with additions including a choir loft, vestibule and exorcism room. It could be used by the doctors or the chaplains to administer the sacraments on request.In 1945 the church lost its mantle of the leading Anglican church on the "street", and was reopened and uses increased in 1951. In 1965 it became the home of St David's Carillon, an historic shop.It was reopened in June 2017 and is now the largest church in the London area.

Canadian Soldiers and Sailors Memorial Chapel


The Canadian Soldiers and Sailors Memorial Chapel is located at the Canadian Forces Base Borden at the southern end of the Military Parks. In 2018, it added a third floor furnished with a theater with two Àte d'Hiver and somber interior.


== History ==
In 1907, the chapel was opened to private donations and construction of the chapel (17 tent-shaped battalions) on commission took place from April 1908–October 1911.  Constructed in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, its roof was sandblasted and a bronze figure of the Cross of Sacrifice was added on parades. It is only now being restored due to the types of grading and materials used in new additions. The chapel is now staffed by the Canadian Forces, with its first chaplain, Art Carney-Dupre, serving as the chaplain of the chapel in 1912.


== Exhibits ==
The exhibits include a large collection of battle honours and decorations of military units and their leaders. Today, the majority are of battlefields and Canadian Soldiers.


== Women in the Service-O-Rama Hall ==
In March 2013, the Canadian Forces Women's Memorial Hall was opened in the chapel. Women have participated in several D-Day and other Canadian Forces actions. The chapel is now staffed by seven women.

== Biography ==
Born in Puerto Rico, Calrejon attended the University of Florida and Yale Law School. He served in the United States Navy during World War II, receiving a certificate in combat medics and a Bronze Star. Calrejon received a law degree from Santa Clara University.

After President Gerald R. Ford appointed him to the Supreme Court in 1979, the Justices and their families were taken by surprise when Attorney General Jack Quinn appointed Calrejon as a federal judge. The court had been conducting a routine review of several non-recent appeals and had recently received a letter from the Supreme Court about the nomination. The non-recent cases were the rebuttal of a veteran's constitutional claim regarding the military draft, an appeal against a found unconstitutional summary conviction order and a drug case. On the majority opinion in City of Miami v. Ressler, Justices John Harlan and Stanley Weinberg dissented. The other Justices were Alton W. Bradley of the New York Court of Appeals and Carl H. Heilbroner of the United States Supreme Court.

HMS Burnham (1838)


HMS Burnham is a former landing ship of the Royal Navy. It was launched in 1838, and was given to the Royal Navy in 1842.


== Service ==
Set aside in 1838, Burnham was taken into service in September 1839, and was later paid off in October 1841. She was then sold in January 1863, for one shilling to the Royal Navy. This sale appeared to show a conflict of interest for Lord Carnwath (15 October 1842 - 24 March 1873) who paid £100 in exchange for Burnham and sold under a different name (or imperfect title). The intention was for Burnham to be returned to her owner, but Carnwath sold her for payment. The scandal also meant she was only used once in 1873.

Battle of the Scotia Line


The Battle of the Scotia Line is the name given to the battle of British North America between September 20, 1781 and December 21, 1783. Ostracized by the Iroquois in September 1783, the Canadian soldiers deflected the Iroquois' advances in December, promptly retreating to their native land. Although the battle took place in August 1780, it was the first time in over a decade that Americans and Iroquois Scouts had met. The wars pulled hundreds of Iroquois from the colonies, with many large groups leaving the region and moving to settle in North America. In the continuous barrage used by a U.S. army, only a couple of small engagements with Native Americans have taken place since.

Major, Sydney Naval Hospital


The Major, Sydney Naval Hospital (M.S.H.) was a naval hospital at Sydney Naval and Military Shore Establishment (SNES) Sydney.  The M.S.H. opened over a century ago on 2 March 1848 with ceremonies and the opening of the first hospital to be opened in the history of the Australian navy.  The hospital was on land at Wateringdon Park in suburban Sydney. The site was damaged by World War II.A memorial plaque erected beside the M.S.H. in 2006 notes that the hospital was opened in 1848 by a British admiral, the Hon. William Smith Cambridge.  It includes a plaque in situ inscribed with the date of building of the hospital in 1848.  The plaque displays two bronze figures, one facing the other, side by side, in the prominent positions and the latter from the bow of the ship.  The figures were reproduced from one of the Murmur patronisations. 
A similar plaque, erected in 1996, remembers the church through a prism done in bronze. With the war in the 1990s, the monument came under the care of the Royal Australian Navy. All that was left after 1992 was the single bronze figure from the hospital.
