# Creating new finetuned GPT-2 and GRAN models

See `get_wiki_data.ipynb` for getting text and link data from the Wikipedia API. `make_ego_graph_dataset.ipynb` shows how to use the link data for and make a dataset of egocentric networks for modelling with GRAN.

The `gpt2` and `gran` folders each have instructions for making their respective models.
